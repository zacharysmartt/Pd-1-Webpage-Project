<h1>So who am I exactly?</h1>
<p>I often describe myself as someone who is very calm, thoughtful, and observant. At times, I can
be very hardworking, often trying to stay committed to whatever I'm working on. I am very new to the field of
computer science, and as such, I will try to learn as much as I can so I have the skill to help me make a 
career in this field in the future.</p>
